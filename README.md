Shelld is clear, useful, straight forward shell that can be used at home and can be considered very easy.
So, far this is a free project that is started as hobby to make a custom shell. It can not be compared to others yet, because is not as rich in functionality yet.

The project is focused on C++ implementation mostly as a goal.

Very important to note that it is just a parody, custom version with not ALL functionality of a modern shell. Yes, it is just made to be made...

## Purpose, related and etc

Very important to highlight that asides from just being just a learning project and a fun thingy to test out the Shelld has its own way to run primitive scripts in terms of syntax.
Just use already installed commands to do it. in future more fun stuff will be added if it will...

Just type    ```
   exec myscript
     ```
   

## Installation
1. Clone the repository by typing this in your terminal (git should be installed):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IvanKoskov/Shelld.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory that was created:
   ```bash
   cd shelld
   ```
3. Build the project (or run the shell script that will just place it correctly):
   ```bash
   make
   ```
4. Run the shell:
   ```bash
   ./shelld
   ```
5. Or as you are supposed to do it just type shelld in terminal.

6. Follow te instructions by typing command dude or wha.

Overall the project already include needed building scripts for all, so this wont be a peoblem for you.
