# Shelld
Shell for all unix systems 

Shelld is clear, useful, straight forward shell that can be used at home and can be considered very easy.
So, far this is a free project that is started as hobby to make a custom shell. It can not be compared to others yet, because is not as rich in functionality yet.

The project is focused on C++ implementation mostly as a goal.

Very important to note that it is just a parody, custom version with not ALL functionality of a modern shell. Yes, it is just made to be made...


## Installation
1. Clone the repository by typing this in your terminal (git should be installed):

   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory that was created:
   ```bash
   cd shelld
   ```
3. Build the project (or run the shell script that will just place it correctly):
   ```bash
   make
   ```
4. Run the shell:
   ```bash

   ```
5. Or as you are supposed to do it just type shelld in terminal.
