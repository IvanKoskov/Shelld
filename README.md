# Shelld
Shell for all unix systems 

Shelld is clear, useful, straight forward shell that can be used at home and can be considered very easy.
So, far this is a free project that is started as hobby to make a custom shell. It can not be compared to others yet, because is not as rich in functionality yet.

The project is focused on C++ implementation mostly as a goal.

Very important to note that it is just a parody, custom version with not ALL functionality of a modern shell. Yes, it is just made to be made...
