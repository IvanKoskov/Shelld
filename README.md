Shelld is clear, useful, straight forward shell that can be used at home and can be considered very easy.
So, far this is a free project that is started as hobby to make a custom shell. It can not be compared to others yet, because is not as rich in functionality yet.

The project is focused on C++ implementation mostly as a goal.

Very important to note that it is just a parody, custom version with not ALL functionality of a modern shell. Yes, it is just made to be made...

## Purpose, related and etc

<img width="150" alt="kisspng-terminal-macos-unix-swipe-5abeb39f770cc5 3806324615224472634876" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c42446e3-8de6-40c9-8604-692b750fcbda" />

Very important to highlight that asides from just being just a ```learning project and a fun thingy``` to test out the Shelld has its own way to run primitive scripts in terms of syntax. Terminal is a key thing and even small set of tools is cool more over when it is just simple and is a toy.
Just use already installed commands to do it. in future more fun stuff will be added if it will...

Just type    ```
   exec myscript
     ```
   It is no extension needed as it is just direclty read by a shell and after C++ executes.
   For now there are no loops, functions or something, it is  ONLY commands that you can just organize, customize and etc.

## Who needs?

This can be used on daily life terminal tasks and to just learn if you are not familiar with shell and terminal interaction.
Shelld provieds useful features for cloning reposiories and dowloading softare and source code from open sources and etc.

> [!TIP]
> More documentation and code explanation is inside source code files, consider reading if interested.

## disadvantages kinda

Mainly it is that shelld is not fully complete as a shell like bash and does not have some still useful things like code running and etc. 50/50 and ye there is no apt get (yet maybe).

Btw the fact that it is c++ makes the shell funky .... 

Shelld relies on lost of headers actually, but can be optimized. 


## Installation
1. Clone the repository by typing this in your terminal (git should be installed):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IvanKoskov/Shelld.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory that was created:
   ```bash
   cd shelld
   ```
3. Build the project (or run the shell script that will just place it correctly):
   ```bash
   make
   ```
4. Run the shell or just run the script for startng the shell:
   ```bash
   ./shelld
   ```
5. Or as you are supposed to do it just type shelld in terminal.

6. Follow te instructions by typing command dude or wha.

7. Errors on compiling?
As you will intall shelld you can meet some scary looking errors. In order to fix them run the script to check for all needed headers installed provided in source code.

Overall the project already include needed building scripts for all, so this wont be a peoblem for you.
